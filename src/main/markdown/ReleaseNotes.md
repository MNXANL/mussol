* Changes for release ${revision}  ([Full Log](https://github.com/jflamy/owlcms4/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Aissue+project%3Ajflamy%2Fowlcms4%2F1+))

  * [x] Moving down was wrongly being denied if C&J move down was less than last snatch attempted.
  * [x] Moving down was wrongly being denied when athlete requesting change down to current weight was at a later attempt than athlete whose clock had started.
  * [x] Violations of rules for timing of declarations (before initial 30 seconds), and for changes (before final warning) are now signaled as errors (#425, #426). Overriding is possible for officiating mistakes.
  * [x] Workaround applied for iPad unpredictable response time (from 0.1 to 3 sec. lag) when used as display. The iPad will "skip ahead" to the correct remaining time as soon as the start command is received, and "skip back" on a stop. Only applies to iPads, ignored by all other platforms. (#419) 
  * [x] CSS style sheets for attempt board and decision board are now editable in local/styles (#424)
  * [x] Fix : templates were not being found if "_" present in the installation path (#428)

* Key Highlights from recent stable releases

  - [x] Implemented the rules to prevent athletes from moving down their requested weight illegally.  Moving down is denied if the athlete should already have attempted that weight according to the official lifting order.  The exact checks resulting from applying the TCRR to that situation are spelled out in the [documentation](https://${env.REPO_OWNER}.github.io/${env.O_REPO_NAME}/#/Announcing#rules-for-moving-down). (#418)
  - [x] For cloud-based competitions, setting the time zone can now be done directly from the Competition Information page. (#422).
  - [x] Marshall can no longer edit or overwrite lift results by mistake. An explicit checkbox is required to enable edit (#286)
  - [x] Solo mode where a single technical official uses the good lift/bad lift buttons on the announcer screen now correctly supports decision reversal within 3 seconds, and correctly ignores multiple clicks. (#281)
  - [x] iPads now supported as refereeing device with Bluetooth buttons (running either the athlete-facing time+decision display or the attempt board display.)   Sound is enabled by touching a screen button once when the board is started. (#408). Note that iPads may lag by a second or two compared to other devices (will be worked around in a future release)
  - [x] Reorganized documentation pages for setting up Virtual Competitions.  Documented use of Zoom and OBS for videoconferencing and live broadcast streaming. Added introductory videos to the documentation, accessed from the home page.  Updated the Refereeing section to cover Bluetooth keypads.  Added instructions for using a cheap Fire TV Stick as a display device.
  - [x] Support for large competitions on Heroku. Added documentation for [economical use of Heroku professional tiers](https://${env.REPO_OWNER}.github.io/${env.O_REPO_NAME}/#/HerokuLarge). Heroku now provides the memory defaults for all configurations.
  If you are limited to using the free setup and need to stretch it to its maximum, set the `_JAVA_OPTIONS` configuration variable to something like `-Xmx384m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=80m`
  - [x] New: added a new item for video broadcasts in the technical configuration section. Video capture using OBS or similar streaming software is awkward when a PIN or password is set.  If it is known that the video operator is working from a safe setting (such as a home network) , a "backdoor" setting (OWLCMS_BACKDOOR if using an environment variable) can be used to allow password-less login from a comma-separated list of addresses.  Use with care.
  
  * [x] Improvement: New scoreboard with multiple IWF age group rankings (Youth, Junior, Senior).  Final package also includes the three rankings. (#372)
