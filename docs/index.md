# Olympic Weightlifting Competition Management System 

This software is a full rewrite of a package which has been used to manage Olympic Weightlifting competitions world-wide since 2009.

The application can be used for anything from a club meet using a single laptop all the way up to a national championship with several platform, full jury, integration with streaming, and public internet scoreboards.

## Demo

The following videos and demos are available

- [Simple setup](Demo1): running a minimal setup for a small club meet with a single person controlling the meet.
- [Full setup](Demo2): running a regular or virtual competition with technical officials
- Live demo: after watching the videos, try the [Live demo](Demo3) site, or better yet, [install your own copy](installationOverview) and experiment.

## Installation

Several options are available for installation, depending on your needs. Additional details and diagrams are available in the [**Installation Overview**](InstallationOverview) and [Equipment Setup](EquipmentSetup) pages.
