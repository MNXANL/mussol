# OWLCMS - Olympic Weightlifting Competition Management System 
This software is a complete rewrite of `owlcms` which has been used to manage Olympic Weightlifting competitions since 2009. This 4<sup>th</sup> generation of the software uses up-to-date technologies to run both on local machines (Windows, Linux, Mac) or in the cloud (Heroku, Kubernetes)

The application can be used for anything from a club meet using a single laptop all the way up to a national championship with several platform, full jury, integration with streaming, and public internet scoreboards.

### Features and Documentation

See the application [Web Site](https://owlcms.github.io/owlcms4/#) for a full overview.  The following short videos demonstrate using the software in minimalist mode for a [very simple club meet](https://owlcms.github.io/owlcms4/#/Demo1) and using the typical features for a [full competition](https://owlcms.github.io/owlcms4/#/Demo2) (on-site or virtual).

### Installation Options
Several installation options are possible, depending on what is available at the competition site

#### Easiest: Cloud-Based Installation

- If there is good internet communication at the competition site, the process is extremely simple. 

  - There is a one-click install procedure to a *free* (0$) cloud service called Heroku (a division of Salesforce.com). 
  - The install will create your *own private copy* of the application, with your *own database*.
  - The owlcms software runs as a web site. All the various display screens and devices connect to the cloud using the competition site's network.

#### Stand-alone: Laptop installation

If there is no good Internet connectivity at your competition site you can use a stand-alone setup and run the software on a laptop.  In that setup: 

- The OWLCMS software runs on a laptop (labeled owlcms in the diagram) which acts as a web server to the other screens and displays.
- The primary laptop and all the other screens and official stations are connected to a wi-fi network.  If there is none in the building, you will need to configure a local router and connect all machines to that router (exactly like a home network).
- All machines need a web browser to drive their display or screen.
- You can run owlcms on the same machine as one of the officials.  It is often the case that owlcms runs on the same machine as the announcer or the competition secretary.
- In the following drawing phones are shown as the referee device.  But you can actually referee using hand signals, flags, phones, or dedicated keypads (USB or Bluetooth). See [this page](https://owlcms.github.io/owlcms4/#/Refereeing)

See the following instructions

  * [Windows Stand-alone Installation](https://owlcms.github.io/owlcms4/#/LocalWindowsSetup)
* [Linux or Mac Stand-alone Installation](https://owlcms.github.io/owlcms4/#/LocalLinuxMacSetup)

#### Cloud-Based Virtual Competitions

In a virtual competition, the officials are in multiple locations.  In order to allow access by all officials, `owlcms` is run in the cloud with [remote refereeing](Refereeing#Mobile-Device-Refereeing) and video conferencing.
